Translate the following natural language sentences into Property Specification Language (PSL) and explain your translation step by step.
The most commonly used PSL operator is the "suffix-implication" operator (also known as the "triggers" operator), which is denoted by |=>. Its left operand is a PSL regular expression and its right operand is any PSL formula (be it in LTL style or regular expression style). The semantics of r |=> p is that on every time point i such that the sequence of time points up to i constitute a match to the regular expression r, the path from i+1 should satisfy the property p. This is exemplified in the figures on the right.
The regular expressions of PSL have the common operators for concatenation (;), Kleene-closure (*), and union (|), as well as operator for fusion (:), intersection (&&) and a weaker version (&), and many variations for consecutive counting [*n] and in-consecutive counting e.g. [=n] and [->n].
PSL also has LTL-style operators. PSL has a "next" operator meaning at the next clock cycle, "until_" means until, "always" means at any point in time, "eventually" means at some point in the future.
In the following we specify an ABMA AHB.
Natural Language: When the slave is not selected by the decoder, HREADY signal shall be high.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "When" from the input refers to the PSL operator "always", meaning that it should hold at any point in time. "the slave is not selected" from the input translates to ! HSEL, "HREADY signal" from the input translates to HREADY, and "shall be" represents an implication.
Explanation dictionary: {"When" : "always", "the slave is not selected": "! HSEL", "HREADY signal": "HREADY", "shall be": "->"}
FINAL: always (! HSEL -> HREADY)FINISH
Natural Language:  If memory is full and write transfer is attempted, then the slave shall send an ERROR response.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "If ... then" from the input translates into an implication. "memory is full" from the input translates to the variable FULL, and "write transfer is attempted" from the input translates to WR.
"the slave shall send" translates to HRESP =, and "ERROR responese" translates to ERROR. Additionally, it is implictely the case that HSEL holds, and it is also implicitely given that this is true at any point in time.
Explanation dictionary: {"If... then": "->", "memory is full": "FULL", "write transfer is attempted": "WR", "the slave shall send": "HRESP = ", "ERROR response": "ERROR"}
FINAL: always ((HSEL && FULL && WR) -> (HRESP = ERROR))FINISH

Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often".
The formula should only contain atomic propositions or operators |, &, ~, ->, <->, X, U, G, F.
